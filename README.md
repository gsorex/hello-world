um...idk
So as the instructions instruct, I am supposed to write a bit about myself. But that would be a disclosure of confidential information to stangers on a repository that is to remain public- therefore, I will not. Yet despite this, my previous sentence already reveals a lot about me. Someone who truly wanted to remain private would have left this blank. Was this intential? Was it planned?
IDK...
